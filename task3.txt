How is web3 used in componentDidMount? How does the user connect to the blockchain network? This is metamask!
web3 gets the state of the local blockchain and all important info that we need(accounts, network, etc.). The user connects via metamask and web3

pick one function: fetchLoot, addLoot, or buyLoot and explain in detail what it is doing and how it works. Every line please!
buyLoot = (ev) => {
const { contract, accounts } = this.state; //This gets the contract and accounts objects so we can interact with it later in the function
ev.preventDefault(); //This is a javascript function that checks if the event is not explicitly handled, then it's default action should not be taken-mozilla
this.setState({ loading: true });//Set the loading state to true
contract.methods.buyToken(this.state.buying.id).send( //This calls the buyToken method with the msg.sender being accounts[0] and the msg.value being the price and the _tokenId being the id in state
    { from: accounts[0], value: this.state.buying.price }
).then(() => this.fetchLoot()).then(() => { //This calls calls fetchLoot to change some state variables
    this.setState({ buying: null }); //Change out of buying into a different state on the frontend
}, (err) => {
    console.error(err); //Error checking
    alert('Creating the token faile!'); //Creating error alert
    this.setState({ buying: null }); //Change state to null on frontend since we are no longer buying.
})
}
